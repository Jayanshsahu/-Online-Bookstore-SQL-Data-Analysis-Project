üìå Project Overview

                This project simulates an online bookstore's database system, focusing on 
                managing books,customer information, and order history. The project involves
                creating and populating SQL tables,performing data queries, and conducting comprehensive
                analysis to extract key business insights using PostgreSQL #SQL #DataAnalysis #Bookstore



üéØ Objective

                The aim of this project is to:

                Design and create a relational database for an online bookstore.

                Import real-world structured data into tables.

                Use SQL queries to derive useful insights for business decisions like revenue tracking, 
                customer behavior, inventory management, and sales performance.
